# Chinese-English-Translation-Machine-Based-on-sequence-to-sequence-network

hello there,

here 2nd Experiment of Deep Learning. This is part 2 of all 3 parts, you can check my other repositries for other 1st and 3rd experiments.
All files of Experiment 2 are here

here is abstract of this experiment:

Abstractâ€” In this test we will see machine interpretation starting with one language then onto the next, by what means would we be able to gather and get ready information. We are making an interpretation of Chinese language to English language.
